# ArrowToken



> Arrow Token Implementation

This is an upgradeable contract that conforms to the ERC-20 standard

*Upgrades can be made directly on this contract as versioning will be handled by git. However, one needs to keep any potential storage collisions in mind when introducing new variables/functions*

## Methods

### allowance

```solidity
function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256)
```



*See {IERC20-allowance}.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| owner | address | undefined |
| spender | address | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | uint256 | undefined |

### approve

```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external nonpayable returns (bool)
```



*See {IERC20-approve}. NOTE: If `amount` is the maximum `uint256`, the allowance is not updated on `transferFrom`. This is semantically equivalent to an infinite approval. Requirements: - `spender` cannot be the zero address.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| spender | address | undefined |
| amount | uint256 | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bool | undefined |

### balanceOf

```solidity
function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256)
```



*See {IERC20-balanceOf}.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| account | address | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | uint256 | undefined |

### decimals

```solidity
function decimals() external view returns (uint8)
```



*Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation. For example, if `decimals` equals `2`, a balance of `505` tokens should be displayed to a user as `5.05` (`505 / 10 ** 2`). Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between Ether and Wei. This is the value {ERC20} uses, unless this function is overridden; NOTE: This information is only used for _display_ purposes: it in no way affects any of the arithmetic of the contract, including {IERC20-balanceOf} and {IERC20-transfer}.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | uint8 | undefined |

### decreaseAllowance

```solidity
function decreaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 subtractedValue) external nonpayable returns (bool)
```



*Atomically decreases the allowance granted to `spender` by the caller. This is an alternative to {approve} that can be used as a mitigation for problems described in {IERC20-approve}. Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance. Requirements: - `spender` cannot be the zero address. - `spender` must have allowance for the caller of at least `subtractedValue`.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| spender | address | undefined |
| subtractedValue | uint256 | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bool | undefined |

### increaseAllowance

```solidity
function increaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 addedValue) external nonpayable returns (bool)
```



*Atomically increases the allowance granted to `spender` by the caller. This is an alternative to {approve} that can be used as a mitigation for problems described in {IERC20-approve}. Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance. Requirements: - `spender` cannot be the zero address.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| spender | address | undefined |
| addedValue | uint256 | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bool | undefined |

### initialize

```solidity
function initialize(uint256 _initialSupply, string _name, string _symbol) external nonpayable
```

Mint an `_initialSupply` amount of tokens upon contract creation

*If we were to upgrade the initializer by introducing new variables, we need to create a normal function like `initializeV2` (https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/uups-proxies-tutorial-solidity-javascript/7786/53), and make sure to include all existing variables from the current version of the contract to avoid storage collision*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _initialSupply | uint256 | undefined |
| _name | string | undefined |
| _symbol | string | undefined |

### mint

```solidity
function mint(address _to, uint256 _amount) external nonpayable
```

Mint and issue new tokens to a specified address



#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _to | address | the address to issue new tokens to |
| _amount | uint256 | the amount of tokens to be mint and transfered to `_to`  |

### name

```solidity
function name() external view returns (string)
```



*Returns the name of the token.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | string | undefined |

### owner

```solidity
function owner() external view returns (address)
```



*Returns the address of the current owner.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | address | undefined |

### proxiableUUID

```solidity
function proxiableUUID() external view returns (bytes32)
```



*Implementation of the ERC1822 {proxiableUUID} function. This returns the storage slot used by the implementation. It is used to validate that the this implementation remains valid after an upgrade. IMPORTANT: A proxy pointing at a proxiable contract should not be considered proxiable itself, because this risks bricking a proxy that upgrades to it, by delegating to itself until out of gas. Thus it is critical that this function revert if invoked through a proxy. This is guaranteed by the `notDelegated` modifier.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bytes32 | undefined |

### renounceOwnership

```solidity
function renounceOwnership() external nonpayable
```



*Leaves the contract without owner. It will not be possible to call `onlyOwner` functions anymore. Can only be called by the current owner. NOTE: Renouncing ownership will leave the contract without an owner, thereby removing any functionality that is only available to the owner.*


### symbol

```solidity
function symbol() external view returns (string)
```



*Returns the symbol of the token, usually a shorter version of the name.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | string | undefined |

### totalSupply

```solidity
function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256)
```



*See {IERC20-totalSupply}.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | uint256 | undefined |

### transfer

```solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external nonpayable returns (bool)
```



*See {IERC20-transfer}. Requirements: - `to` cannot be the zero address. - the caller must have a balance of at least `amount`.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| to | address | undefined |
| amount | uint256 | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bool | undefined |

### transferFrom

```solidity
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external nonpayable returns (bool)
```



*See {IERC20-transferFrom}. Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance. This is not required by the EIP. See the note at the beginning of {ERC20}. NOTE: Does not update the allowance if the current allowance is the maximum `uint256`. Requirements: - `from` and `to` cannot be the zero address. - `from` must have a balance of at least `amount`. - the caller must have allowance for ``from``&#39;s tokens of at least `amount`.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| from | address | undefined |
| to | address | undefined |
| amount | uint256 | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|

function transferOwnership(address newOwner) external nonpayable
```



*Transfers ownership of the contract to a new account (`newOwner`). Can only be called by the current owner.*

### upgradeTo
